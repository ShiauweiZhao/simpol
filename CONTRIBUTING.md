# Contribute to SimPol

This guide details how to use issues and pull requests to improve SimPol.

Please stick as close as possible to the guidelines. That way we ensure quality guides
and easy to merge requests.

Your Pull Request will be reviewed by one of our devs/volunteers and you will be
asked to reformat it if needed.

Please continue to use MATLAB 2019a when working on the `.mlapp` files for consistency reasons.
For modifications of `.m` files, any MATLAB version can be used.
Only use a version later than 2019a if really required.

## Issues

Open an issue if you want to report a bug or suggest a feature.

Use the provided issue templates and fill them out as much as possible.

## Merge Request title

Try to be as more descriptive as you can in your Merge Request title.

Particularly if you are submitting a new feature or your modifications require 
a higher minimum version of MATLAB or Polarion.

For example some good titles would be:

* [topic] MATLAB 202Xx - Polarion 2XRX
* [cool new feature] MATLAB 2021a - Polarion 21R1

If your pull request does not require a new version of MATLAB or Polarion, you don't need to provide the version numbers in the title.
